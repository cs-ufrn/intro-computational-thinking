# Introduction to Computational Thinking

This is an introductory talk about computational thinking for beginners.
The aim is to present the task of programming not just as
writing lines of code, but as a way of abstracting complex problems, through
logic, criativity and Computer Science's fundamentals, 
for solving them using a sequence of well-defined steps.
Programming logic is first presented using online
programming blocks tools, then a simple guessing game (check the `code/guess-range` folder)
is written in Python for getting the audience familiar
with basic Python constructions.
